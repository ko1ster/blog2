  "content": "Nobody knows your brand better than you do. This is why when we set out to create the framework for material design, we were sensitive to the ways in which third-party developers might leverage the system. We wanted material design to give comprehensive guidance for designing effective and elegant UIs — taking a strong position on motion, dimensionality, color, and graphic hierarchy — but with enough latitude to allow for various levels of engagement. You don’t have to adopt every element of the material design system in order for it to be beneficial to your identity system. Whether it’s a custom font, a unique color story, or distinct voice, everything that provides stylistic distinction in a product should be celebrated and supported in the material design framework. We’ve laid out the top brand touchpoints to help illustrate the system’s flexibility and give designers and developers a road map for showcasing their brand identity."
