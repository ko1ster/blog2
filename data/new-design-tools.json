  "content": "This week on Google Design, we published a roundtable discussion with Matias Duarte and the founders of Pixate and RelativeWave, Paul Colton and Max Wiesel. To prepare for the interview, I turned to my design brethren on Medium (and beyond!) to learn more about their experiences working with some of the more popular prototyping tools available today, as well as their hopes and dreams for the next generation of design software. Here are a few of the stories I found helpful for framing the discussion. A thorough account of using Form (pre 1.3) for the first time, from the perspective of a designer who is less familiar with Quarz Composer, with built prototypes to help synthesize the material covered in each section. Also worth reading: Cesâ€™ great tutorial exploring material design in Origami."
