  "content": "The road from design to production is often hard-won, filled with well-intended design detours, steep learning curves, and the occasional road block. Here’s a common scenario: A team of designers begins building wireframes for a new product. Several weeks, revisions, and pin-ups later, they emerge with a “final,” “shippable” file, which they hand off to the development team. The engineers poke holes in the design, deeming several elements “unbuildable,” and begin rendering out some semblance of the design in code. Several weeks later, they deliver a staging site. The designers are thrilled—this is the first time they’ve seen their design IRL—but are quickly deflated when they realize how much of the design has been lost in translation. The typography is wonky. The animations and interactive elements need to be re-tuned. A volley of annotated emails with screenshots ensues, until finally, the designer and developer sit side-by-side, and visually adjust the design directly in code."
